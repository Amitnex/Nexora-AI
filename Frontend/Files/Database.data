The dog is a Golden Retriever with a fluffy golden coat and a wagging tail. It has big brown eyes and a friendly smile on its face. The dog is sitting on a green grassy field, surrounded by a few trees and a sunny sky above.
Would you like me to describe something else, Boss?
Boss: Sorry could not understand.

Nexora AI: I think you're saying that you didn't understand what I meant when I said I could describe a picture of a dog. That's okay, Boss! It's a bit tricky to understand. Just know that I can only communicate with you using words, and I can't create or show images. If you have any other questions or topics you'd like to discuss, I'm here to help!
