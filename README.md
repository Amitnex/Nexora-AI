# 🛠 SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS
To successfully run this AI project, please ensure the following software is installed:

Python version 3.10.10

Visual Studio Code with the Python extension

Confirm that all installations and configurations are completed correctly before proceeding.

# 🔐 API KEY CONFIGURATION
The .env file contains multiple API keys that enable the AI to perform advanced functions.
Please ensure you replace the placeholder API keys with your own valid credentials for each service.

# ⚙️ SETTING UP THE VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT (.venv)
Do not manually create a __pycache__ folder—this will be automatically generated when the virtual environment is installed.

To set up the virtual environment:
Open the terminal in VS Code by pressing Ctrl + '.
Enter the following command in terminal:

python -m venv .venv
This will create a .venv directory in the root of your project, containing all necessary dependencies.

# 💾 FILE MANAGEMENT
After inserting or editing any code, press Ctrl + S to save your changes.
Saving frequently ensures the application runs smoothly and reduces potential performance issues.

To launch the AI system, simply run the main.py file.
